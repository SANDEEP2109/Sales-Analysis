Sales Analysis Report – Power BI Project
This project is a simple yet insightful Sales Analysis Dashboard created using Power BI Desktop. It focuses on visualizing sales data from a fictional retail dataset to identify trends across regions, product categories, and time.

What the Report Shows:
Overall Sales Summary: The total sales across the entire dataset.

Sales by Region: A breakdown of sales across the West, East, Central, and South regions, helping to identify top-performing areas.

Sales by Category: A comparison of sales for major product categories — Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies.

Sales by Month: Trends in sales activity over the months of the year, created by extracting the month from the order date using a DAX formula.

How It Was Built:
The data was cleaned and visualized using Power BI Desktop.

A custom column (MonthNumber) was created using DAX to extract the month from the order date.

Visuals like pie charts, bar charts, and line charts were used to represent the data in an easy-to-understand format.
